# Asynchronous Programming Exercises

This project demonstrates various asynchronous programming techniques in JavaScript, including callbacks, promises, and async/await.

## Project Structure

### Files

- **async-await.html**: Demonstrates the use of async/await for handling asynchronous operations.

- **callbacks.html**: Demonstrates the use of callbacks for handling asynchronous operations.

- **promises.html**: Demonstrates the use of promises for handling asynchronous operations.

- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript code for handling asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await.

- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the HTML files.

## How to Run

1. Open any of the HTML files (`async-await.html`, `callbacks.html`, or `promises.html`) in a web browser.
2. Click the button on the page to see the asynchronous operation in action.

## Asynchronous Techniques

### Callbacks

Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, which are then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

### Promises

Promises represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. They provide a cleaner and more manageable way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks.

### Async/Await

Async/await is a syntactic sugar built on top of promises, allowing you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner. It makes the code easier to read and maintain.
